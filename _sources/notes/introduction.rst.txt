Overview
-----------------

*HyperTrack* is a new hybrid algorithm for deep learned clustering based
on a learned graph constructor called Voxel-Dynamics, Graph Neural Networks
and Transformers. For more details, see the paper and the conference talk.

This repository together with pre-trained torch models downloaded from Hugging
Face can be used to reproduce the paper results on the charged particle
track reconstruction problem.


Hugging Face Quick Start
------------------------------

Install the framework, process TrackML files, download pre-trained torch models from
Hugging Face https://huggingface.co/mieskolainen into ``/models`` and follow the documentation for inference.
